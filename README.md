Warning:
The Manifest this Manager uses to find out where mods are is still in development and doesn't have a lot of mods added yet and not all of them support the new mod structure required some entries in the manifest are completely broken and don't work at all accidentally installing a broken mod should not result in any errors and doesn't install the mod. Expect the Manifest to be extended in the near future.
